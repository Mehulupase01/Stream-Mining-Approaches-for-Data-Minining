# Stream Mining Approaches for Data Minining
 This project implements essential stream mining algorithms, including Reservoir Sampling, Bloom Filter, and Flajolet-Martin for probabilistic counting. These algorithms are designed to efficiently process large data streams, providing methods for random sampling, set membership testing, and cardinality estimation
